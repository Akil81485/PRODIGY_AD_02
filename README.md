# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Android Development Task

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents Task 2 of the internship, which focuses on building a basic calculator app for Android.

## Task Overview

The objective of this task is to develop a calculator app for Android that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Steps

1. **Setup Project**: 
   - Create a new Android project in Android Studio.
   - Configure project settings including project name, package name, and target SDK.

2. **Design UI**:
   - Implement the user interface for the calculator using XML.
   - Include buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), and display area for showing results.
   - Arrange the UI components in a `GridLayout` for organized and accessible button placement.

3. **Implement Logic**:
   - Write Java code in `MainActivity.java` to handle button clicks and perform arithmetic operations.
   - Implement logic to manage the display area, capture input, and perform calculations.
   - Ensure correct handling of operator precedence and edge cases (e.g., division by zero).

4. **Write Tests**:
   - Develop instrumented tests to verify the app’s functionality and correctness.
   - Create test cases to validate basic arithmetic operations and edge scenarios.
   - Use Espresso for UI testing and verify that the calculator performs as expected.

5. **Build & Run**:
   - Compile the app using Android Studio and resolve any build issues.
   - Test the app on an Android device or emulator to ensure it operates as expected.
   - Verify that all functionalities work correctly and that the app handles user input gracefully.

## Knowledge Gained

- **Android Application Development**: 
  - Gained practical experience in setting up and managing an Android app project.
  - Learned how to use Android Studio for development and debugging.

- **User Interface (UI) Design**:
  - Acquired skills in designing intuitive and functional user interfaces for mobile applications.
  - Implemented layouts using XML to create a responsive and user-friendly calculator interface.

- **Handling Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Developed logic to handle arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Implemented functionality to manage operator precedence and handle input errors.

- **Testing in Android**:
  - Developed skills in creating and executing instrumented tests using Espresso.
  - Ensured the app’s reliability and functionality through rigorous testing.

## Summary

This task involved the development of a basic calculator app for Android, covering the following aspects:
- **Project Setup**: Configured and initialized an Android project.
- **UI Design**: Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for the calculator using XML.
- **Logic Implementation**: Developed the core logic to handle arithmetic operations and manage user interactions.
- **Testing**: Created and ran instrumented tests to validate the app’s functionality and correctness.

The provided instrumented tests confirm that the app’s context is correctly configured and that core functionalities are operational.

## Conclusion

The task successfully demonstrated the fundamental steps required to build a basic calculator app for Android, including:
- Effective design and implementation of the user interface.
- Development of core arithmetic functionalities.
- Application of testing practices to ensure app reliability.

These experiences highlight essential skills in Android app development, showcasing the ability to create functional, reliable, and user-friendly mobile applications.
